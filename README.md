# Based off [Kviks Psych Engine Android Port 0.3.3](https://github.com/kviks/Psych-Engine-Android/tree/Psych-Engine)
### This was originally a branch in the VS Cirno Android Port and now its a repo for future ports
Although its based off an old Psych Engine (0.3.2) Android (0.3.3) version it has the Psych Engine 0.4.2 Input (used in my Psych Engine 0.3.2 Hotfix Repo) because its better (and because I know how to use this version)

Wiki will be finished once I have enough time to focus on that lol
